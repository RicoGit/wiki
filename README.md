## Overview

The short version is Truebit is an incentivized scalability solution for distributed trustless networks.<br/>
The protocol is enforced by playing an interactive "game". The interactive game involes certain roles and pieces of software that comproise the truebit protocol.<br/>
Before we see what "playing the game" means lets first look at some definitions:<br/>
First we'll definge the roles:<br/>

### Roles
* Taskgiver: is the miner posting a task that requires verification on whether or not the task was carried out correctly by the Solver.<br/>
* Solver: is the miners chosen to run the task for a reward.<br/>
* Verifier(s): are the miners that check the task and it's computation posted to the blockchain by the solver.<br/>
* Challenger(s): are the verifiers that see a mismatch between the hashes of the Truebit machine posted on the blockchain by the solver and their own hashes of the internal state of the truebit machine generated by the truebit offline interpreter.<br/>
* Referees(s): are the miners that will oversee the time-outs imposed on the verification game while the solver is solving the task and verifiers are verifying it.<br/>
* Judges(s): are the miners<br/>

### Components
* Off-chain Interpreter:<br/>
* On-chain Interpreter:<br/>
* Truebit Contract:<br/>
* Incentive Layer:<br/>
* Dispute Resolution Layer:<br/>
